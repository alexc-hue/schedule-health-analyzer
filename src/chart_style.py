"""Standardized chart color system and chrome (status scale, baseline/reference).

CHART_BG/INK/GRID/SERIES_1 and apply_chrome() stay byte-for-byte identical
across all six github.com/alexc-hue project-controls repos (schedule-health-
analyzer, project-controls-dashboard, change-control-register,
risk-trend-tracker, project-controls-reporting-engine,
recovery-scenario-planner); each repo adds only the extra constants its own
charts use (SERIES_2/3, STATUS_*, BASELINE), so files diverge beyond that
shared core by design. Each repo carries its own copy so it stays
independently cloneable and runnable on its own. project-controls-dashboard
is the canonical source for the shared core -- update it there first, then
re-sync the rest.
