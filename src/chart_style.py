"""Standardized chart color system and chrome (status scale, baseline/reference).

The core palette (CHART_BG/INK/GRID/SERIES_1) and the apply_chrome() function
are kept in sync, byte-for-byte, across all six repos in the
github.com/alexc-hue project-controls toolkit (schedule-health-analyzer,
project-controls-dashboard, change-control-register, risk-trend-tracker,
project-controls-reporting-engine, recovery-scenario-planner). Beyond that
shared core, each repo defines only the additional constants its own charts
actually use -- SERIES_2/SERIES_3 for multi-series charts, the STATUS_*
scale for status-colored charts, BASELINE for charts that plot a
reference/baseline series -- so file contents diverge repo to repo by
design, even though the shared core does not. Each repo carries its own
copy so it stays independently cloneable and runnable without pulling in
the others, the same rationale the vendored engines already document.
project-controls-dashboard is the canonical source for the shared core; if
the palette changes, update it there first and re-sync the rest.
